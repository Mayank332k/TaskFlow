# TaskFlow 🗂️

TaskFlow is a simple task management application built using React.  
The project focuses on clean state management, predictable UI behavior, and understanding how real React applications are structured.

---

## 🚀 Overview

TaskFlow allows users to manage tasks by adding, updating, completing, and deleting them.  
The main goal of this project was to strengthen core React fundamentals such as global state handling, reducers, and conditional rendering, rather than relying on external libraries.

## 🚀 Overview

TaskFlow is a task management application built using React, with a strong focus on **predictable state management** and **clean application structure**.

The goal of this project was not flashy animations or heavy libraries, but to understand how real-world React apps manage data, state, and UI flow in a maintainable way.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me deeply understand core React concepts, including:

- Managing global state using the **Context API**
- Choosing **useReducer** over multiple useState hooks and knowing why
- Writing **pure reducer functions** for predictable updates
- Implementing complete **CRUD operations**
- Structuring **action types and payloads** correctly
- Handling **empty states** with conditional rendering
- Separating app-level logic from UI components
- Thinking in terms of **data flow**, not just UI changes
- Finishing and deploying a project instead of endlessly refactoring it

---

## 🧩 Concepts Used

- React Functional Components  
- Context API  
- useReducer  
- useState  
- Conditional Rendering  
- Immutable State Updates  
- Component Composition  
- Basic React Application Architecture  

---

## 🎨 UI & Design

- The **UI is fully custom-designed**
- Layout, flow, and structure were planned and built manually
- The focus was on **clarity, simplicity, and usability**

For productivity:
- AI tools were used as **assistants**
- Suggestions were reviewed, modified, or rejected
- Final logic, structure, and decisions were entirely mine

AI helped speed things up. It didn’t do the thinking.

## 🎨 UI & Design

- The **UI design is completely my own**
- Layout, structure, and user flow were designed manually
- Focus was on clarity, simplicity, and usability

For efficient development:
- **AI tools were used as assistants**
- AI-generated suggestions were reviewed and modified
- Final logic, structure, and implementation decisions were fully mine

AI was used to speed up development, not to replace understanding.
